1. Prepare test client environment
1.1 Install VS2015 Enterprise
1.2 Install Azure SDK for VS2015
1.3 Open VS2015, you should be able to find two add-ons for storage management
1.3.1 View -> Cloud Explorer -> Storage Accounts (this is our P0)
1.3.2 View -> Server Explorer -> Azure -> Storage (this is our P1)

2. Prepare test server environment
2.1 You will need a MASD or NebulaAzure WOSS/ACS cluster to run test against
2.2 You will need an AAD account for WOSS/ACS tenant to sign in WOSS/ACS services
2.3 You will need some WOSS/ACS storage accounts to use in testing (You can create some storage accounts using Account.exe or from the VS2015 tools)
2.4 You may need to hack DNS if in a NebulaAzure environment with host style URI used

3. Follow the scenarios below, and record EVERY steps/commands you run and the results you get (first run on Cloud Explorer, then Server Explorer)
NOTE: Some cases may only valid for one tool, not the other.
3.1 Verify that an AAD account for WOSS/ACS can be used to sign in Cloud Explorer or Server Explorer
3.2 Verify that all the subscriptions of the signed in AAD account is listed in the tool and refresh works
3.3 Verify that all the storage accounts of the subscriptions are listed in the tool and refresh works
3.4 Verify that a storage account can be created successfully in the tool
3.5 Verify that a storage account can be deleted successfully in the tool
3.6 Verify that an external storage account can be added to the tool successfully
3.7 Verify that properties of a storage account can be viewed and managed in the tool
3.8 Verify that all the tables/queues/blob containers are listed for a storage account and refresh works
3.9 Verify that tables/queues/blob containers can be created successfully
	Blob: 
	1. Go to Server Exploer->Azure->Storage node
	2. Select a storage account and Blobs node
	3. Right click Blobs node and select create a blob container
	4. Enter a name for the blob container
	5. Click OK to create the container
	Expected Result: a blob container is created successfully
3.10 Verify that table/queue/blob containers can be deleted successfully
3.11 Verify that table/queue/blob containers can be opened and viewed successfully
3.12 Verify that properties of a table/queue/blob container can be viewed and managed successfully
3.13 Verify that table entities can be listed, filtered, added, deleted and refreshed successfully
3.14 Verify that blobs can be listed, filtered, uploaded, downloaded, deleted and refreshed successfully
3.15 Verify that queue messages can be listed, added, deleted, cleared and refreshed successfully

4. The output should be document about EVERY test steps and commands you run, and their output and results
