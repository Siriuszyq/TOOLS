1. Read the document: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/storage-use-azcopy/

2. Prepare test environment
2.1 You will need a Windows Client to run the tests
2.2 You will need some public Azure storage accounts to compare results with, sometimes
2.3 You will need a MASD or NebulaAzure WOSS/ACS cluster to run test against
2.4 You will need some WOSS/ACS storage accounts to use in testing (You can create some storage accounts using Account.exe or some other ways)
2.5 You may need to hack DNS if in a NebulaAzure environment with host style URI used

3. Follow the document to run the following scenarios, and record EVERY steps/commands you run and the results you get
3.1 Blob: Download - EXCLUDE "Download single blob from secondary region"
	Download all blobs
	1. Open Microsoft Azure Storage command line
	2. Import: AzCopy /Source:https://sdktest2.blob.core.windows.net/test1 /Dest:C:\Users\v-yiqz\Documents /Sourcekey:FjUfNl1KiJttbXlsdkMzBTC7WagvrRM9/g6UPBuy0ypCpAbYTL6/KA+dI/7gyoWvLFYmah3IviUP1jykOHHOlA== /S
	
	Download single blobs
	AzCopy /Source:https://sdktest2.blob.core.windows.net/test /Dest:C:\Users\v-yiqz\Documents /Sourcekey:FjUfNl1KiJttbXlsdkMzBTC7WagvrRM9/g6UPBuy0ypCpAbYTL6/KA+dI/7gyoWvLFYmah3IviUP1jykOHHOlA== /Pattern:"test.txt"
	1. The syntax of the command is incorrect. The "SourceKey" parameter is only valid when the source is an Azure Storage location.
3.2 Blob: Upload
	Upload single file
	1. Open Microsoft Azure Storage command line
	2. Import: azcopy /Source:C:\Users\v-yiqz\Documents\GitHub\TOOLS\AzCopy /Dest:http://sdktest2.blob.core.windows.net/test1 /DestKey:FjUfNl1KiJttbXlsdkMzBTC7WagvrRM9/g6UPBuy0ypCpAbYTL6/KA+dI/7gyoWvLFYmah3IviUP1jykOHHOlA== /Pattern:"tests.txt"
	3. Display: Finished 1 of total 1 file(s).
	[2016/05/25 02:34:45] Transfer summary:
	-----------------
	Total files transferred: 1
	Transfer successfully:   1
	Transfer skipped:        0
	Transfer failed:         0
	Elapsed time:            00.00:00:04
	Expected Result: Upload single blob file successfully

3.3 Blob: Copy - EXCLUDE "Copy single blob from secondary region to primary region"
3.4 Table: Export
3.5 Table: Import
3.6 Other AzCopy features - please try them to see if work or not; EXCLUDE "Run AzCopy against Azure Storage Emulator" 
3.7 AzCopy Parameters - read these carefully, try every parameter in your command (You may check some articles in Next Steps section), 
    for example: /BlobType, /CheckMD5, /Snapshot, /L, /PKRS, /SplitSize, /Manifest, /EntityOperation, /SyncCopy, /SetContentType, /PayloadFormat, ......
3.8 Run "AzCopy /?" to get help and explore more AzCopy options during test

4. The output should be document about EVERY test steps and commands you run, and their output and results
