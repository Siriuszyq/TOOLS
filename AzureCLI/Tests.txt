2. Prepare test environment
2.1 You will need a Windows Client to run the tests (for both Windows test and Linux test)
2.1.1 Install PuTTY from: https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty-0.67-installer.msi
2.1.2 Use PuTTY to ssh to the following linux boxes for testing
	[USE THIS] Fedora: 10.156.72.33 sdktest User@123
2.2 You will need some public Azure subscriptions and storage accounts to compare results with, sometimes
2.3 You will need a MASD or NebulaAzure WOSS/ACS cluster to run test against
2.4 You will need some WOSS/ACS subscriptions and storage accounts to use in testing (You can create some storage accounts using Account.exe or some other ways)
2.5 You may need to hack DNS if in a NebulaAzure environment with host style URI used

3. Follow the document 1.0 and 1.1 to run the following scenarios, and record EVERY steps/commands you run and the results you get
NOTE: the tests need to be run on two platforms separately - run on Windows Platform, run on Linux Platform in PuTTY from Windows Client

[Document 1.0]
3.1 Use azure login to authenticate interactively

[Document 1.1]
3.2 Setting the Resource Manager mode
3.3 azure storage: Commands to manage your Storage objects - EXCLUDE "Storage file" related commands
3.4 Run "azure storage" and "azure storage <command> --help" to get help and explore more options during test

4. The output should be a document about EVERY test steps and commands you run, and their output and results
